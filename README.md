# (HPC) High-performance computing
A high-performance computing library focused on developing useful code blocks and intrusive containers with reduced memory fetches, continuous memory, and improved locality to minimize cache misses. It employs a branchless and lockless approach whenever possible, along with efficient synchronization that scales linearly with CPUs, ensuring efficient execution in userland.
